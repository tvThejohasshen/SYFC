      <h1>Our Principles</h1>
<ol>
  <li>We accept that giving our resources is a necessary part of our expression of what service to God is. We will do our best to ensure that all our ministry activities are self-supporting. We will avoid being wasteful or lavish in our spending. 
    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+2%3A9&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="1 Thessalonians 2:9 - For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God."><span class="highlight">1 Thess 2:9</span></a>
  </li>
  <li>We accept and willingly participate in raising our own financial support because we believe:
    <ul>
      <li>It allows us to exercise our faith in God whom we believe provides for all our needs. 
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A8&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="2 Corinthians 9:8 - And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work."><span class="highlight">2 Cor 9:8</span></a>
      </li>
      <li>It allows those who support us financially to be in partnership with us in youth evangelism and missions. 
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A5&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Philippians 1:5 - because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now."><span class="highlight">Phil 1:5</span></a>, 
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A15-16&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Philippians 4:15-16 - And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only."><span class="highlight">Phil 4:15-16</span></a>
      </li>
      <li>It will benefit our financial supporters. 
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A17&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Philippians 4:17 - Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit."><span class="highlight">Phil 4:17</span></a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We recognize that leadership is our responsibility but servanthood is our position. 
    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A42-45&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Mark 10:42-45 - But Jesus called them to him and said to them, 'You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'"><span class="highlight">Mk 10:42-45</span></a>
  </li>
  <li>We will respond quickly and creatively to changes in order to be effective in youth evangelism and yet remain true to the preaching of the apostolic gospel. 
    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A19-23&version=ESV" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="1 Corinthians 9:19-23 - For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law."><span class="highlight">1 Cor 9:19-23</span></a>
  </li>
  <li>In their first encounters with SYFC, we would like:
    <ul>
      <li>Non-Christian youths to see SYFC as an organization that provides meaningful fun.
